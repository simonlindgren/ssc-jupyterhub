# JupyterHub on Swedish Science Cloud

This guide is based on [torkar](https://github.com/torkar)'s excellent [tutorial](https://torkar.github.io/comp.html) about RStudio for SSC, and on my own [guide](https://github.com/simonlindgren/jupyterhub-setup) for setting up JupyterHub.

## Get access to SSC

If you work at a Swedish university, you can apply for free computing resources from Swedish Science Cloud.

1.  Go to [SNIC SUPR](https://supr.snic.se/) and set up an account (login with your university account).
2.  Create a new proposal and wait for it to be approved (usually a day or two).
3.  Go to https://cloud.snic.se and chose the appropriate region (WEST-1, EAST-1, NORTH-1).

## Create a machine

1. Go to Compute → Images. Pick OS and click `Launch` to the right. I chose Ubuntu 22.04.
2. 'Launch Instance' settings:
    - Details: Enter an instance name, e.g. RebelAllianceMegaHub.
    - Source: Make sure that your chosen OS is picked.
    - Flavor: Pick desired hardware. I chose `ssc.xlarge.highcpu`.
    - Networks: Pick the NAISS network.
    - Network Ports: Skip for now.
    - Security Groups: Make sure `default` is picked.
    - Key Pair:
        - Create a Key Pair. 
        - Select nothing in the dropdown menu.
        - Keep  the resulting *.pem file on your local system. I named mine `key.pem`.
        - Make sure to restrict permissions on that file (e.g.,`chmod 600 key.pem`).
    - Remaining settings: Do nothing.
    - Click `Launch Instance`.
  3. Go to Compute → Instances and make sure that the Power State is `Running`.
        - Click to the right and associate a floating IP with your internal IPv4 address.
  5. Go to Network → Security groups → Manage rules.
        - Click `Add Rule` and add the rule for SSH. Leave the CIDR at `0.0.0.0/0`.
        - For running JupyterHub, open port `443`for the ip.
            -`Add Rule`-> `Custom TCP Rule`-> Port: `443`.

## Install JupyterHub 
1. SSH to the machine: `ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ubuntu@<server-ip>`.
2. Use the guide available at https://github.com/simonlindgren/jupyterhub-setup to setup JupyterHub.
